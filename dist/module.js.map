returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node, key,
